# 🎵 Twitch Chat Ding

**Twitch Chat Ding** is a super lightweight tool that plays a *beep* every time someone chats in your Twitch channel — while ignoring common bots like **StreamElements**, **WizeBot**, **SoundAlerts**, and more.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Simple**: Just open a link, no installs.  
- **Filtered**: Skips noisy bots so you only hear *real people*.  
- **Customizable**: Edit the blocked list directly on the page.  
- **Open Source**: Free for anyone to use or modify.
